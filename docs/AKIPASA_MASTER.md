## 2026-10-26 | Direct workspace icon navigation

Owner-requested sign-in refinement: the five icon cards are the navigation
links themselves. Remove the visible previous/next controls, caption/count and
separate Open/current-workspace row from every public login chooser. Swiping
and Arrow/Home/End browse the carousel without navigation or draft changes;
an explicit tap/click or Enter on an icon follows its canonical localized link.
Suppress the compatibility click after a horizontal swipe so it cannot open an
app accidentally. Current app identity uses aria-current; browsing is distinct
from authorization and never submits the sign-in form. The private lab keeps
its original radio-selection controls by default through an opt-in link mode.

Dependencies: identical React engine/adapter/CSS copies in Pasa, Duermo, Coches
and HQ; equivalent static Business adapter at both guest sign-in entries.
Business selector assets advance to v2 and production offline cache to 155,
with release assertions retained. Existing bounded referral-only href helper,
EN/ES, product icons/palettes, reduced motion, roving focus, 44px active targets
and phone placement after the form remain. No session, permission, identity,
price, tenant, API/provider, database, analytics or customer-data changes.

Validation: destination/keyboard/private-lab regressions plus responsive browser
checks for first-click icon navigation, swipe click suppression, retained draft,
no footer/actions, localized/referral-safe URLs and zero scene scroll. Complete
hosted source/browser/Cloudflare checks and exact live-source verification are
required before release; installed native/device acceptance remains separate.
Rollback is a source revert and renewed Business asset/cache versions.


## 2026-10-26 | Cinematic AkiSelector energy and transitions

The login selector now uses five distinct vector-mask materials: Pasa flame
tongues/cinders, Duermo tidal ribbons, Coches diagonal velocity trails, HQ
precision orbital tracks and Business spectral curtains. The existing generic
effect IDs remain compatible with the private lab. Every activation has a
brief lens flare, dissipating wave and glass reflection. Outgoing artwork stays
mounted for a 650ms opacity decay; incoming energy ramps over 280ms while card
travel eases over 680ms. Interrupted changes converge via CSS transitions,
without JavaScript animation frames or timeouts. Inactive material loops pause.

Mouse hover previews only energy and retains selection, roving focus, current
app and href geometry; pointer exit restores selected energy. Touch/pen retain
swipe browsing and direct icon navigation with the compatibility-click guard.
Keyboard input clears hover preview. EN/ES, referral-only links, preserved
login drafts, mobile placement and administrator-only lab boundaries remain.
Both explicit motion-off and OS reduced motion remove loops/transitions/flare.

Dependencies: shared React engine/CSS in Pasa, Duermo, Coches and HQ; equivalent
DOM adapter and identical CSS in Business. Business engine CSS, adapter CSS and JS URLs advance to
v2/v3/v3 and its effective paid release cache to v156, including release assertions.
No authentication exchange, session, API, tenant/role, database, storage,
analytics, payment, provider configuration or Android binary change. This is
web-delivered presentation. Rollback restores source and advances static asset
versions/cache again. Source and real-browser evidence is recorded in the PR;
full CI, production deployment and physical-device acceptance are separate gates.


## 2026-10-26 | Product-specific AkiSelector opening stories

The five login choices opt into an optional product arrival independently from
the reusable ember/breeze/bloom/solar/aurora idle effect. Pasa drops a discovery
pin and sparks; Duermo rolls and softly lands a suitcase; Coches sends a red
coupe with spinning wheels and a light wake across the foreground; free AkiHQ
gathers locations into a management hub; operations AkiBusiness wakes a till
and prints a receipt. Each decorative vector story plays once over 1.25–1.7s,
then disappears as its material rises into the sustained hovering/orbit phase.
The Coches idle is slower and includes a red orbital arc. Returning to an app
restarts its story; uninterrupted idle does not replay it. Generic lab effects
remain compatible without product stories unless the caller opts in.

Dependencies: AkiSelector option arrival, WorkspaceSelector adapter, shared CSS
and the equivalent static Business DOM adapter. All artwork is inline SVG masks
and CSS; no image/provider calls, animation timers or new packages. Decorative
actors ignore pointer events and are hidden from assistive technology. Direct
links are immediate, with no animation wait; browsing, safe referral/locale
URLs, drafts, keyboard focus, swipe suppression and auth/session/permissions
remain intact. Reduced motion and motion-off hide opening stories and keep
static idle artwork. Business engine CSS v3 / adapter CSS v3 / JS v4 and the
effective release cache v157 advance together with release assertions.

Validation includes all five actual actor animations becoming visible, finishing
once and handing off to full idle opacity, plus source/component/browser parity.
The current report records completed checks and separate broader map acceptance.
No production data, SQL, storage, billing, analytics, provider configuration or
Android binary changes. Source revert plus fresh static versions is rollback.
GitHub publication is still awaiting the explicit authorization requested earlier;
no push, PR, merge or deployment is implied by this design refinement.
